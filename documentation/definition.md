# Project definition

- In this project, I will be using Python and doing the documentation and code in English. When it comes to other languages, I am familiar enough with Java to give feedback on other projects.

- I want to study (4) different data structures, and how they operate under different circumstances and how they 'rank up' against each other. I will start implementing this as soon as I get the green light from the course instructor regarding the projects general idea and that it is extensive enough.

- The different algorithms and data structures to be used in this project will be informed later.

- Actual inputs and outputs will be determined later, however a simple non-graphical user interface will be implemented to operate the application.

- Time- and space requirements, limitations regarding each data structure will be determined later.

- Sources will be informed later.

- I am a TKT-student.
