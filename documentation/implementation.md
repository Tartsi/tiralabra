# Implementation Report

- ChatGPT 4 was utilized for information retrieval during this project

### General Structure

- A terminal operated Gomoku game played on a 20x20 game board. AI-opponent in the game utilizes Minimax that is optimized with Alpha-Beta pruning and dynamic listing.

- The code is modularized into three main classes and an UI-class:
    - AI-class: which includes everything related to the AI the game uses, mainly minimax and evaluation functions.  
    - Board-class: defines the board used in the game, and board for simulations during minimax-algorithm.
    - Logic-class: handles the 'logic' for the actions on the board (movement), and actions regarding different situations (win/draw).
    - The UI-class handles the game-loop which operates the game and turns, and manages the dynamic listing of possible moves on the actual game board.

- Python lists are used to create the 2D-array representation of the board, and to store information regarding made and potential moves for the AI.
- ~~If iterative deepening is to be implemented, Python dictionaries will also be utilized for generating best possible move for each situation~~. Not implemented, dynamic listing used instead (Python lists).
- Evaluation functions in the AI-class look for line lengths and possible open ends and then returns values based on these parameters.
- The possible moves for the AI are listed as free squares within two squares of previously made moves, maintaining a dynamic list of these potential move positions, which is then optimized further by moving 'neighboring' moves of the recent move towards the end of the list.
- Minimax-algorithm is optimized with Alpha-Beta pruning and utilizes the dynamic listing explained above. In combination with these optimizations, the algorithm iterates over the list of possible moves in reverse order, thus maximizing the potential acquired from Alpha-Beta pruning.
- The acquired depth is 4. Lowering the depth will make the AI's decisions faster, at the cost of the AI's skill level, as lower depth limits its ability to foresee and evaluate future possibilities. Increasing the depth will increase the difficulty level of the AI, however the time required for each move will increase exponentially.

### Achieved Time and Space Complexity

- The project achieves time complexity with Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning which is O(b^(d/2)) under optimal conditions, (where "b" is the branching factor and "d" is the depth of the tree). Move pruning also reduces the branching factor significantly.

- Space complexity is heavily dependent on the size of the potential moves considered at each stage of the algorithm and the depth used in minimax-algorithm and can be quite significant.
  
### Current State and Improvement suggestions

- The state of the game as of 08.03.2024 is as follows:

    - The AI plays as it should given the depth and evaluation functions used in the program.

    - In the current state of the game, the AI will always play as 'X' (and thus move first), the human player will play as '0'.

    - TODO: ~~Fix AI 'giving up' - make it return the best possible move regardless of game state~~. Fixed as of 05.03.2024

    - TODO: ~~Fix AI playing itself into a 'trap'. At the moment it plays a 4-line even if both sides are blocked, and 5-line is impossible to achieve~~. Fixed as of 02.03.2024

    - TODO: ~~Draw situation is not implemented yet (this is a complete oversight by me unfortunately)~~. Fixed as of 21.02.2024.
 
- Improvement suggestions for future:
  - Add tasks
  - Add both sides as playable (AI is always X currently)
  - Add option to replay directly from command line
