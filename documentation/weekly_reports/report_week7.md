# Progress report week 7:

- Monday 26.02.2024:
  - Reviewed code. (30 minutes)
  - Started working on iterative deepening optimization. (1h)
- Tuesday 27.02.2024:
  - Continued working on iterative deepening and drafted a first version of it on a separate branch. (3h)

- On Tuesday 27.02.2024 I was able to draft a version of iterative deepening. This is the first version and will likely be updated further as the week progresses. It is an required optimization for the project.
- Apparently it 'automatically' fixed the problem of the AI 'giving up'. AI now returns a valid, good move even when faced with an inevitable loss situation.
