# Progress report week 7:

- Monday 26.02.2024:
  - Reviewed code. (30 minutes)
  - Started working on iterative deepening optimization. (1h)
- Tuesday 27.02.2024:
  - Continued working on iterative deepening and drafted a first version of it on a separate branch. (3h)
- Wednesday 28.02.2024:
  - Spent entire day working on different solutions for iterative deepening and dynamic listing solutions and ultimately had to scrap most of the code I wrote during this time. (4h)
- Thursday 29.02.2024:
  - Worked on a new approach to a dynamic listing solution, preliminary testing seemed promising. Possible changes might be coming in the future. (4h)
- Saturday 02.03.2024:
  - Finished and merged dynamic listing. (30 minutes)
  - Updated documentation. (1h)

- On Tuesday 27.02.2024 I was able to draft a version of iterative deepening. This is the first version and will likely be updated further as the week progresses. It is an required optimization for the project.
- On Thursday 29.02.2024 I had to scrap most of the progress I made this week, and started finding new solutions for dynamic listing which is a required optimization for the project. I made good progress today and hopefully this improved solution will be final and acceptable.
- Finished the project on Saturday 02.03.2024.
