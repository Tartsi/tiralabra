# Progress report week 3:

- Wednesday 31.01.2024:
  - Studied external material about Minimax-algorithm. (1h 30min)
  - Started implementing Minimax-algorithm, and its helper functions in code. (1h 30min)
- Thursday 01.02.2024:
  - Studied external material about Minimax-algorithm and possible solutions. (1h)
  - Added more functionality to Minimax-algorithm and its helper functions. (3h30min)
- Friday 02.02.2024:
  - Studied possible code refactoring opportunities. (30 minutes)
  - Actualized said code refactoring. (3h)
- Saturday 03.02.2024:
  - Studied overall code structure, reviewed methods and updated documentation. (30 minutes)

- This week I was able to start implementing the Minimax-algorithm, and got some process in, albeit I do not think it works optimally yet. The AI-is lacking all 'sense' at the moment and is making same choices over and over, apparently because the evaluation function is not yet finished. This will be addressed next week. The UI now uses this current version of the minimax-algorithm and its helper functions.

- I will hopefully get some counceling from course instructors next week about my current process and about testing of the minimax-algorithm and/or other tests that are required.

- For course instructor: Has the program advanced enough? What tips or instructions can you give me at this point?
