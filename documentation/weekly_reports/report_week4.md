  - Studied code and external material about potential approaches (1h)
- Wednesday 07.02.2024:
  - Troubleshot problems related to heuristics (2h)
  - Started rewriting heuristic solutions (1h)
- Thursday 08.02.2024:
  - Rewrote algorithms related to heuristics + new tests (4h)
- Saturday 10.02.2024:
  - Update documentation (1h)

- This week I finished the Minimax-algorithm. It now has Alpha-Beta pruning and manual tests seem to work relatively well. The AI's heuristical evaluation functions are now optimized and the AI-opponent is relatively difficult to beat. You can still utilize some moves to beat the AI consistently as not all game scenarios or strategies are covered, however this is to be addressed before full release, but in a free flowing game it operates relatively well.

- I think the project is at the point where it is peer-revieable and I think this would help me make it better.

- Overall, I feel like this week was a success.
