- Saturday 24.02.2024:
    - Updated documentation and identified fixes for next week. (30 minutes)

- Once again I was rather limited on time and tried to manage and optimize it as well as possible. Most of the progress done this week is listed above. Fixes for next week have been also identified.
  
- The opened a branch for iterative deepening - optimization was not advanced; simply do not have enough time to do this at the moment and rather will try to make the game as playable as possible otherwise.

- Next week I will make the AI return the best move even when faced with a inevitable loss situation and make the AI not play itself into a 'trap' as mentioned in the implementation-document. Will naturally also look for other improvements if there is enough time.

- For the course instructor: How is the course looking so far? Is the work done seemingly enough to be an acceptable project so far?
