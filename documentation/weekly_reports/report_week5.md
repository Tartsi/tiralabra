# Progress report week 5:

- Tuesday 13.02.2024:
    - Studied, and added peer-review to the project assigned for me. (3h)
    - Full review of my own projects code and documentation, as well as comments. (1h)
- Wednesday 14.02.2024:
    - Studied external material about iterative deepening. (2h)
    - Started applying this to the project. (1h)
- Thursday 15.02.2024:
    - Advanced iterative deepening-optimization. (2h)

- Overall, this week I was not able to advance the project that much, as I was very limited on time due to personal reasons.
  
- This week I opened a branch for iterative deepening - optimization, however it is not fully working yet. Main-branch version of the code is however very playable.

- Next week I will add draw for the game as this has been missing so far, and I will also review the issue opened on my code, and do necessary modifications regarding that.
