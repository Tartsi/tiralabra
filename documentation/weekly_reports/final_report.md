# Final progress report:

- Sunday 03.03.2024:
    - Made dynamic listing changes in order to improve performance for increased depth. (3h)
    - Code did not work properly, so discussed it with course instructor. (15 min)
- Monday 04.03.2024:
    - Reviewed code as it did not work properly. Could not fix it, so needed to book a Zoom-meeting related to it for Tuesday. (2h)
- Tuesday 05.03.2024:
    - Had a Zoom-meeting with course instructor, where we fixed the issues with the code. (2h)
- Friday 08.03.2024:
    - Added more minimax testing. (30 minutes)
    - Updated documentation. (1h)
    - Reviewed code for final return. (1h)

- I was able to fix the problems within the code with the help of course instructor Hannu Kärnä. It eventually turned out that my minimax was not 'mirrored' and was missing the update_possible_moves - function in the minimizer. This was causing the AI to make weird, incoherent decisions.

- Ultimately I am happy how the project turned out. Biggest regret is that I did not start coding both players as playable in the beginning, and this is the first priority which I would fix.

- Finished the project on Friday 08.03.2024.
