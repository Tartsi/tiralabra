# Progress report week 2:

- Wednesday 24.01.2024:
  - Studied course page and material (20 minutes)
  - Setup Poetry, Project dependencies, Continuous Integration in GitHub (1h)
  - Started implementing core of the program, in this case gameboard. (1h 30 minutes)
- Thursday 25.01.2024:
  - Studied external material, code examples (1h)
  - Wrote game-functionality and more comprehensive testing, refactored code (3h)
- Friday 26.01.2024:
  - Studied external material, code examples; especially related to MiniMax-algorithm, and alpha-beta pruning (2h 30 minutes)
  - Added more game-functionality + tests related to win-checks, code refactoring (1h 30 minutes)
  - Added a UI and a simple 'Stupid AI' to test the gameboard and to test the user interface manually (1h)
- Saturday 27.01.2024:
  - Studied external material about MiniMax-algorithm, thought about code modularization (2h)
  - Added 'blueprint' for AI-module and skeleton-versions of supporting functions (1h)

- With the course instructors help I was able to start building my project. My goal was to build the 'core' for the program this week and have it ready for next week's big algorithmic steps. I am relatively happy with my own progress this week.

- The program has a simplistic UI with a 'stupid AI', mainly for manual testing purposes. It also has a 'blueprint'-module for the actual implementation of more complex functions and algorithms. Some of these functions are already implemented as 'skeletons' within the code.

- This week was a great learning experience regarding the minimax-algorithm and alpha-beta pruning. I am still slightly unfamiliar with the concept of Move Pruning optimization, however I will focus on this next week, as well as the implementation of other complex algorithms and functions. All the commented out functions, and the AI-module are to be actualized next week.

- For course instructor: Is the program in a satisfactory state at this point in time? What tips or instructions can you give me at this point?
